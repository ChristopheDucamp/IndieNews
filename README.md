# IndieNews

This site will eventually live on http://news.indiewebcamp.com. It is a news aggregator for [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com)-related posts.

To submit one of your posts, link to http://news.indiewebcamp.com/ from one the post and send a [Pingback](http://indiewebcamp.com/pingback) or [WebMention](http://webmention.org) to http://news.indiewebcamp.com/.

This project is still very much in progress. It's probably best if you don't go anywhere near it yet.
